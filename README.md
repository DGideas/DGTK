# DGideas Cognitive Toolkit
The DGideas Cognitive Toolkit (DGTK), is an open source data-analysis toolkit.

# Download
You can use DGTK directly by clone this repository, then see [Using](#Using). 
You must include the whole ```dgtk/``` directory when you use it.

The most recommend way is goto [DGTK Release Page](https://github.com/DGideas/dgtk/releases), 
then choose a version to download, we put all DGTK code into whole one file. 
So you can use it more conveniently.

# Using
```C++
#include "dgtk.hpp"
```
